# State Variation in Racial Stereotypes

This repository contains a predictive model of state variability in the stereotype that Black Americans are violent. The primary features of interest are racial differences in crime rates from state to state. Data are from 2006 - 2014. Analysis scripts in Python and R are provided.

Target: 
* Explicit Black-violence stereotype data from Project Implicit based on an online survey of 348k Americans.

Features: 
* State murder rate data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation based on 77k murders.
* State homicide rate data from the Center from Disease Control based on 108k homicides.
* State demographics from the Census Bureau: age, sex, race, income, conservatism, and education.

I predicted race-specific data on violent crime (homicide and murder rates) would partially explain state level variation in the stereotype that Black Americans were violent.
* In states where *White* Americans commit more violent crime, the Black-violence stereotype should be *weaker*.
* In states where *Black* Americans commit more violent crime, the Black-violence stereotype should be *stronger*.
